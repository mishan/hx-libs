//! Opcodes and data-field tags, keyed to the wire constants in
//! `src/hotline.h`.
//!
//! Two shapes are used deliberately:
//!
//! - **Header opcodes** are modelled as enums ([`ClientHdr`], [`ServerHdr`]),
//!   one per direction. Within a direction the values are distinct, so an
//!   enum is honest and gives us exhaustive-ish `match`. Both are
//!   `#[non_exhaustive]` — mhxd's ChangeLog adds opcodes over time and a new
//!   server constant should not be a breaking change for a downstream
//!   `match` (it falls through to the catch-all).
//!
//! - **Data-field tags** are modelled as plain `u16` constants in [`tag`],
//!   *not* an enum, because the wire deliberately reuses values across
//!   contexts: `0x0065` is simultaneously `CHAT`, `MSG`, `NEWS_POST`,
//!   `AGREEMENT`, and `USER_INFO` depending on the enclosing opcode. A Rust
//!   enum can't carry duplicate discriminants, and pretending these are
//!   distinct would misrepresent the protocol.
