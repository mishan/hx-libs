//! Receive-dispatch routing: map an incoming server frame's `type` opcode to
//! the handler category `rcv.c`'s `hx_rcv_hdr` selects. This is the pure,
//! exhaustively-tested core of the receive dispatch —
//! the opcode→handler decision, including the composite-`TASK` mask some servers
//! use — lifted out of the C `switch` so a mis-mapped opcode is caught by a unit
//! test rather than only in production against a live server.
//!
//! The C side (`hx_rcv_hdr`) keeps the per-kind side effects it always had (the
//! `POLITEQUIT` notice, the "unknown header type" log for [`HandlerKind::Unknown`])
//! and the `htlc->rcv` assignment; this crate just makes the decision.
//!
//! Opcode values mirror `src/hotline.h` (the wire authority). The unit tests
//! pin every one.

/// The handler category for a server→client opcode. `#[repr(i32)]` with
/// explicit discriminants; the C mirror `hx_recv_handler_kind`
/// (`hotline_proto.h`) restates the same integers and must be kept in step by
/// hand. What's tested is the routing *behaviour* — see
