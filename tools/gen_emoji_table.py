# Generator for crates/hxproto/src/emoji_table.rs.
#
# Emoji shortcodes (the :joy: convention) are not standardised by Unicode.
# The de-facto names come from GitHub's "gemoji" set plus the Slack
# additions. The Python `emoji` package vendors exactly that material: each
# entry carries a CLDR English name (`en`, e.g. ":face_with_tears_of_joy:")
# plus the gemoji/Slack-style aliases (`alias`, e.g. [":joy:"]). We treat
# the gemoji/Slack aliases as canonical for ENCODE (they're what people
# actually type) and accept every grammar-valid name for DECODE.
#
# This generator is run by hand and its output (emoji_table.rs) is checked
# in, mirroring how src/text.rs's Mac Roman table was generated once from
# iconv and committed. Re-run after bumping the `emoji` package:
#
#     pip install emoji --break-system-packages
#     python3 tools/gen_emoji_table.py > crates/hxproto/src/emoji_table.rs
#
# Shortcode grammar (must match the scanner in emoji.rs): [a-z0-9_+-]+
# Names that don't fit (uppercase, parentheses, accented CLDR names) are
# dropped — the alias usually covers the same emoji with a clean name.

    # shortcode must satisfy two things:
    #   1. round-trip: it has to DECODE back to THIS emoji, so we only
    #      consider names whose decode owner is `ch`. This avoids the
    #      collision where ☔'s shortest name "umbrella" actually decodes to
    #      ☂ (which claimed it first) — ☔ instead gets its next shortest
    #      uniquely-owned name, "umbrella_with_rain_drops".
    #   2. brevity: among the round-trip-safe names, pick the SHORTEST,
    #      tie-broken alphabetically for determinism. (The `emoji` package's
    #      alias/en split isn't "short vs verbose" — e.g. ⏭️'s short name
    #      ":next_track_button:" is the `en` while its only alias is the
    #      53-char ":black_right_pointing_double_triangle_with_vertical_bar:"
    #      — so we minimise over the union.)
    # An emoji all of whose names were claimed by others is left out of
    # ENCODE entirely (it stays a literal emoji on the wire — i.e. the
    # pre-feature '?' fallback on Mac Roman); vanishingly rare.
